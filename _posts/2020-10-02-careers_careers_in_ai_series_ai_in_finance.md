### About the intersection  
<br>

*Today, machine learning has come to play an integral role in many parts of the financial ecosystem, from approving loans, to credit scores, to managing assets, and assessing risks.*  
<br>

##### What is the financial industry about?    
The financial industry refers to the economy segment that is dedicated to the management of money and investments. The sector comprises a broad range of businesses and institutions including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms, all dedicated to providing financial services to people, corporations, and governments.  
<br>

##### Why consider machine learning in finance?  
Given the high volume of accurate historical records and quantitative nature of the finance world, few industries are better suited for artificial intelligence.  

Financial data is constantly being created by personal devices, online and market activity. The quick and easy access to vast amounts of private and public data together with secure and powerful cloud computing platforms provide the perfect scenario for the adoption of AI technologies.   

Most companies in the space understand the potential of AI and have been adopting the technology. Some of the key drivers include the reduction in operational costs due to process automation, the increased revenues thanks to better decision making, better compliance, and reinforced security. However, there are still many challenges in efficiently applying machine learning to financial data.   
<br>

##### The intersection   
AI is rapidly reshaping the business landscape of the financial industry. A global survey done by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the World Economic Forum, which interviewed 151 big financial firms and FinTech’s across more than 30 countries, suggests that AI is a crucial business driver in the industry. Several examples of AI initiatives at the largest banks are listed below:  

- JP Morgan is using AI to automate credit agreement analysis.  
- Wells Fargo announced the creation of a dedicated Artificial Intelligence Enterprise Solutions team which will pursue payments technologies and improved customer experience for corporate banking customers.  
- Bank of America released an AI-powered virtual assistant that is planned to be implemented in their mobile app and ATM network.  
- Citibank has made several investments in AI related companies, including Feedzai which uses AI to identify and fight fraud in online banking, or Clarity Money which recommends financial products to help customers save money and better manage their finances.  
<br>

##### Future  
Digital assistants and apps will continue to perfect themselves thanks to cognitive computing. There are high hopes for the increased transactional and account security, especially as the adoption of blockchains and cryptocurrency expands. We also expect to see better customer care, as natural-language processing advances and learns more from the expanding data pool of past experience. A new level of transparency will stem from more comprehensive and accurate know-your-client reporting and more thorough due-diligence checks, which now would be taking too many human work hours.
<br>
<br>

### Types of Applications

Many AI solutions have emerged in the financial sector. Below you may find some of the most popular applications, which include fraud detection, advisory services, personal financial management, trading assistance and execution.  
<br>

##### Financial Advisory Services  
Personal AI financial assistants are built from a collection of different technologies to help users in assessing their overall financial status and improving their financial position. Furthermore, advisors are also able to ascertain risk tolerance and recommend appropriate investments and financial products.  
<br>

##### Cybersecurity and Fraud Detection  
Fraud is an extremely serious issue in the financial field. In terms of fraud detection, AI has proven itself to be extremely useful and accurate. Comparing a customer’s spending behaviour against huge amounts of historical data allows for extremely sophisticated and proactive fraud alerts, which are continually evolving. Darktrace and Vectra are examples of companies providing AI-based cybersecurity solutions to major financial institutions.  
<br>

##### Credit decision  
High credit scores unlock the access to favourable financing options, however credit risk is dependent on many variables which makes it difficult to assess. Artificial intelligence solutions are helping banks and credit lenders make smarter decisions by utilizing a variety of factors that accurately assess traditionally underserved borrowers in the credit decision making process. Zestfinance, Datarobot and Underwrite.ai are examples of companies operating in this space.  
<br>

##### Risk Assessment  
Accurate forecasts are crucial to the speed and protection of many businesses. Financial markets are leveraging the machine learning capabilities to create models that generate accurate forecasts, helping financial experts utilize existing data to pinpoint trends, identify risks, conserve manpower and ensure better information for future planning. Kensho and Ayasdi are examples of companies that implement AI to improve prediction accuracy and to manage risk.  
<br>

##### Quantitative Trading  
Quantitative trading is a market strategy that uses large datasets to derive insight on how to optimally trade. In this sector, AI tools are implemented to analyse complex data faster and more efficiently than humans. The resulting algorithmic trading can also process trades automatically, saving valuable time. Alphasense, Kavout and Alpaca are examples of companies providing AI tools that help financial institutions to optimise their trading strategies.  
<br>

##### Personalised Banking  
AI-based robots are replacing humans in customer services across a wide range of fields. Chatbots have proven to be a powerful tool that boosts customer satisfaction, whilst helping companies to save time and money. Furthermore, these AI assistants use artificial intelligence to generate personalized financial advice and natural language processing to provide instant, self-help customer service. Kasisto and Abe AI are examples of companies using AI to learn from customers and provide a better banking experience.   

Personal financial management has also been a particularly promising space. Some platforms are built to help users manage their personal finances. These tools are highly customisable, and offer the ability to make recommendations, create spending or savings goals, and plan/execute short- and long-term tasks, from paying bills to preparing tax filings. Mint and Wallet are examples of companies dedicated to offer personal financial management tools.  
<br>
<br>

### Types of Companies

- Insurance - AIG, PWC, EY  
- Consulting - Quantum Black, Accenture, IBM  
- FINTECH - Monzo, Revolut, Atom
